# Secure Web Communication and Web Server Performance

### RSA Public Key Encryption

* RSA is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission
* The most popular algorithm for public key encryption is the RSA algorithm \(Rivest, Shamir Adleman\)
* Determining the private key from the public key involves factoring very large numbers
  * but there is no efficient algorithm for factoring large numbers

### Cryptographic Hash Functions

* A hash function or hash algorithm is a function that maps a domain of values into a range of numbers.

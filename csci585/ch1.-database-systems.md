  * Improved:Data sharing,Data security, Data access, Decision making, Data quality: Promoting accuracy, validity, and timeliness of data

Data Redundancy

* Unnecessarily storing same data at different places
* Islands of information: Scattered data locations
* Increases the probability of having different versions of the same data
* Poor data security
* Data inconsistency
* Increased likelihood of data-entry errors when complex entries are made in different files

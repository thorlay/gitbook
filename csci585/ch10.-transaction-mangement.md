# Ch10. Transaction Mangement

* Logical unit of work that must be entirely completed or aborted
* Consists of:
  * SELECT statement
  * Series of related UPDATE statements
  * Series of INSERT statements
  * Combination of SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT statements
* Consistent database state: All data integrity constraints are satisfied
  * Must begin with the database in a known consistent state to ensure consistency
* Formed by two or more database requests
  * Database requests: Equivalent of a single SQL statement in an application program or transaction
* Consists of a single SQL statement or a collection of related SQL statements

### Transaction Properties/ACID

* Atomicity\(原子化\)
  * All operations of a transaction must be completed
  * If not, the transaction is aborted
  * 所有操作单位都被完成
* Consistency
  * indicates the permanence of the database’s consistent state. A transaction takes a database from one consistent state to another. When a transaction is completed, the database must be in a consistent state; if any of the transaction parts violates an integrity constraint, the entire transaction is aborted. 所有 trans 必须符合规范下发生。
* Isolation
  * Data used during transaction cannot be used by second transaction until the first is completed
  * 数据不能同时被多个 trans 使用
* Durability
  * Ensures that once transactions are committed, they cannot be undone or lost
  * 数据不会被任意撤销或丢失
* Serializability
  * Ensures that the schedule for the concurrent execution of several transactions should yield consistent results
  * 并发情况下数据的一致性

#### Transaction Log

* Keeps track of all transactions that update the database 
* DBMS uses the information stored in a log for:
  * Recovery requirement triggered by a ROLLBACK statement 
  * A program’s abnormal termination 
  * A system failure

### Concurrency Control

* Coordination of the simultaneous transactions execution in a multiuser database system
* Objective - Ensures **serializability** of transactions in a multiuser database environment

#### Problems in Concurrency Control

* Lost update • 
  * Occurs in two concurrent transactions when: 
    * Same data element is updated 
    * One of the updates is lost
  * 同时更新某一个数据
*  Uncommitted data 
  * Occurs when: 
    * Two transactions are executed concurrently 
    * First transaction is rolled back after the second transaction has already accessed uncommitted data 
  * 使用即将被 rollback 的数据
* Inconsistent retrievals 
  * Occurs when a transaction accesses data before and after one or more other transactions finish working with such data
  * eg. For example, an inconsistent retrieval would occur if transaction T1 calculated some summary \(aggregate\) function over a set of data while another transaction \(T2\) was updating the same data. The problem is that the transaction might read some data before they are changed and other data after they are changed, thereby yielding inconsistent results

### The Scheduler

* Establishes the order in which the operations are executed within concurrent transactions 
  * Interleaves the execution of database operations to ensure serializability and isolation of transactions 
* Based on concurrent control algorithms to determine the appropriate order 
* Creates serialization schedule 
  * **Serializable schedule**: Interleaved execution of transactions yields the same results as the serial execution of the transactions

### Concurrency Control with Locking Methods

* Locking methods - Facilitate isolation of data items used in concurrently executing transactions 
* Lock: Guarantees exclusive use of a data item to a current transaction 
* Pessimistic locking: Use of locks based on the assumption that conflict between transactions is likely 
* Lock manager: Responsible for assigning and policing the locks used by the transactions

#### Lock Granularity

* Indicates the level of lock use -
* Levels of locking 
* Database-level lock 
* Table-level lock 
* Page-level lock 
  * Page or diskpage: Directly addressable section of a disk 
* Row-level lock 
* Field-level lock

#### Problem

* Resulting transaction schedule might not be serializable 
* Schedule might create deadlocks

### Two-Phase Locking \(2PL\)

* Two-phase locking \(2PL\) defines how transactions acquire and relinquish locks. 
* Two-phase locking guarantees serializability, but it does not prevent deadlocks. 
* The two phases are: 
  * 1. A growing phase, in which a transaction acquires all required locks without unlocking any data. Once all locks have been acquired, the transaction is in its locked point. 
  * 2. A shrinking phase, in which a transaction releases all locks and cannot obtain a new lock.

The two-phase locking protocol is governed by the following rules:

* Two transactions cannot have conflicting locks.
* No unlock operation can precede a lock operation in the same transaction.
* No data are affected until all locks are obtained—that is, until the transaction is in its locked point

### Deadlocks

* Occurs when two transactions wait indefinitely for each other to unlock data 
  * Known as deadly embrace 
* Control techniques
  *  Deadlock prevention 
  * Deadlock detection 
  * Deadlock avoidance 
* Choice of deadlock control method depends on database environment

#### Time Stamping

* Assigns global, unique time stamp to each transaction
  * Produces explicit order in which transactions are submitted to DBMS
* Properties
  * Uniqueness: Ensures no equal time stamp values exist 
  * Monotonicity: Ensures time stamp values always increases
* Disadvantages 
  * Each value stored in the database requires two additional stamp fields 
  * Increases memory needs 
  * Increases the database’s processing overhead 
  * Demands a lot of system resources
* Wait/Die and Wound/Wait Concurrency Control Schemes
  * Wait/Die: old wait young,
  * Wound/Wait : young die

### Optimistic approach: 

* Based on the assumption that the majority of database operations do not conflict 
* Does not require locking or time stamping techniques 
* Transaction is executed without restrictions until it is committed

#### Phases of Optimistic Approach

* During the read phase, the transaction reads the database, executes the needed computations, and makes the updates to a private copy of the database values. All update operations of the transaction are recorded in a temporary update file, which is not accessed by the remaining transactions. 
* During the validation phase, the transaction is validated to ensure that the changes made will not affect the integrity and consistency of the database. If the validation test is positive, the transaction goes to the write phase. If the validation test is negative, the transaction is restarted and the changes are discarded. 
* During the write phase, the changes are permanently applied to the database

# Ch14. Database connectivity

Learning Objective

* About various database connectivity technologies 
* How Web-to-database middleware is used to integrate databases with the Internet 
* About Web browser plug-ins and extensions 
* What services are provided by Web application servers 
* What Extensible Markup Language \(XML\) is and why it is important for Web database development
*  About cloud computing and how it enables the database-as-a-service model



### Database Connectivity

* Database middleware: Provides an interface between the application program and the database § Data repository - Data management application used to store data generated by an application program
* Universal Data Access \(UDA\): Collection of technologies used to access any type of data source and manage the data through a common interface
* ODBC, OLE-DB, ADO.NET form the backbone of MS UDA architecture

#### Native SQL Connectivity

* Connection interface provided by database vendors, which is unique to each vendor 
* Interfaces are optimized for particular vendor’s DBMS
* Maintenance is a burden for the programmer

#### ODBC, DAO, and RDO

Open Data base Connectivity \(ODBC\):

* Microsoft’s implementation of a superset of SQL Access Group Call Level Interface \(CLI\) standard for database access
* Widely supported database connectivity interface 
* Allows Windows application to access relational data sources by using SQL via standard application programming interface \(API\)

Data Access Objects \(DAO\): 

* Object-oriented API used to access MS Access, MS FoxPro, and dBase databases from Visual Basic programs
* Provides an optimized interface that expose functionality of Jet data engine to programmers 
* DAO interface can be used to access other relational style data sources

Remote Data Objects \(RDO\)

* Higher-level object-oriented application interface used to access remote database servers

Dynamic-link libraries \(DLLs\)

* Implements ODBC, DAO, and RDO as shared code that is dynamically linked to the Windows operating environment

#### Components of ODBC Architecture:

* High-level ODBC API through which application programs access ODBC functionality 
* Driver manager that is in charge of managing all database connections 
* ODBC driver that communicates directly to DBMS
